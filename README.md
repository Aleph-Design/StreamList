# StreamList
Convert a list of internet radio stations to a structure that can be copied into a selectable array.
That can be used in an Arduino IDE to select internet radio stations.

It's a very simple C-program created in Xcode. It does what it has to do, no fancy things. But,
you can't use it "out of the box".

If you want to use this program, the best thing you can do is to take this source and compile it on 
your own machine. After making adjustments about where you want input and output files.

As allways: the program is "as it is", your on your own.
